# Linux Installers

These are several Linux post install scripts y have prepared over the years. Lately I have been required to do a lot of Linux installations for me and others so I have dug up many scripts, updated a few and added a few others.

## Available Installers (uploads still in progress)

1. Manjaro XFCE BigSur

  Customize Manjaro XFCE for the look and feel of Big Sur (in progress)

```
XFCESur.sh
```

> XFCE is a lightning fast window manager which on top Manjaro, of one of the most acclaimed Distros in terms of speed and completeness, leads to impressive Desktop performance, and this script allows MacOSX switchers to feel at home right from the beginning.

2. Elementary Hera

  Customize Hera with the most important software to have a top-notch Office desktop

```
Elementary_Install.sh
```

> Why choose Elementary for this task? This is because Elementary is based on Ubuntu and thus hast the possibility to enable many popular PPAs (not neccesary curated but functional) to enhance the desktop experience, specially for Linux newbies.


3. Regolith

  Customize Regolith to have an excellent distraction free programming tile window manager (not uploaded yet)

> Regolith is a neat little distro, perfect for power users and programmers who want a distraction free desktop with the power of Ubuntu under the hut. This distro is meant for pros and not for the beginner.

All files do consider fresh installs of the respective distros before starting an install script. Constributions are welcome.

Have fun.
