# Linux Installers

These are several Linux post install scripts y have prepared over the years. Lately I have been required to do a lot of Linux installations for me and others so I have dug up many sprips, updated a few and added a few others.

## Available Installers

1. Manjaro XFCE BigSur
  Personalize Manjaro XFCE for the look and feel of Big Sur (in progress)

2. Elementary Hera
  Personalize Hera with the most important software to have a top-notch Office desktop

3. Regolith
  Personalize Regolith to have an excellent distraction free programming tile window manager

All files do consider fresh installs of the respective distros before starting an install script. Constributions are welcome.

Have fun.
